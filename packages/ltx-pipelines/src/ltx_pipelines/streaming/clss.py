"""
Closed-Loop Streaming Synthesis (CLSS) algorithm components.

CLSS extends Latent Streaming Synthesis (LSS) with three closed-loop corrections that
eliminate the exposure-bias drift accumulation inherent in open-loop streaming:

  §2.1  Calibrated context re-noising
        The overlap latents fed as context to chunk N are re-noised to level τc:
            L̃_overlap = α(τc)·L̂_overlap + σ(τc)·ε   (α = 1−τc, σ = τc)
        In the LTX framework this is achieved by conditioning with
        VideoConditionByLatentIndex(strength=1−τc).  The existing GaussianNoiser
        then naturally applies the formula; the denoising transformer sees those
        tokens tagged with timestep σ·τc instead of 0, so it can actively
        re-project the re-noised context back onto the data manifold.

  §2.3  EMA-tracked per-channel distribution reference
        A slow EMA (rate λ ≈ 0.05) tracks per-channel mean and std across chunks.
        Fast drift (single-chunk statistical error) is suppressed; slow intended
        evolution (lighting changes, scene content) passes through.  Applied as a
        per-channel AdaIN-style renormalisation blended with factor β.

  §2.5  Dynamic anchor bank
        A small bank of anchor keyframes is maintained.  The first frame of the
        first chunk seeds the bank.  Persistent cosine-similarity drops (below
        threshold ρ for two consecutive chunks) trigger a new anchor.  Chunk N
        cross-attends to the top-m most similar anchors, providing soft long-range
        identity without dragging back to a single frozen frame-0 reference.
        Because CLIP is not bundled with LTX, anchor similarity is computed from
        mean-pooled, L2-normalised latent features.

Algorithm 1 (per-chunk step):
  1.  L_overlap  ← SLB.read()
  2.  L̃_overlap ← α(τc)·L_overlap + σ(τc)·ε          [§2.1, via conditioning]
  3.  A_m        ← top-m anchors by feature similarity  [§2.5]
  4.  L_N        ← Generate(L̃_overlap, A_m, prompt)
  5.  L_N        ← AdaIN lerp toward per-channel EMA ref, factor β  [§2.3]
  6.  EMA refs   ← update(L_N); anchor bank ← update on persistent scene change
  7.  SLB.push(trailing frames)

@dataclass
class CLSSConfig:
    """Hyperparameters for Closed-Loop Streaming Synthesis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tau_c:
        Re-noising noise level applied to overlap context (§2.1).
        0 recovers LSS behaviour (maximal continuity, maximal drift accumulation);
        larger values give more distributional repair at the cost of softer
        motion lock.  Recommended range: 0.10–0.20.
    beta:
        AdaIN correction blend factor (§2.3).  0 = no correction, 1 = full
        replacement with reference statistics.  Recommended: 0.2–0.4.
    ema_lambda:
        EMA update rate per chunk (§2.3).  Slow enough to track intended
        scene evolution while suppressing per-chunk drift.  Recommended: 0.05–0.10.
    anchor_threshold:
        Cosine-similarity threshold below which a chunk is considered a candidate
        scene change (§2.5).  Default 0.78 (from the paper).
    anchor_persistence:
        Number of consecutive below-threshold chunks required before a new anchor
        is committed (persistence test, §2.5).  Filters transient occlusions.
    anchor_max_size:
        Maximum number of anchors retained in the bank (§2.5).  Oldest
        least-recently-retrieved anchor is evicted when the cap is exceeded.
    anchor_top_m:
        Number of anchors retrieved per chunk for conditioning (§2.5).
    anchor_strength:
        Denoising strength for anchor keyframe tokens (1.0 = fully clean / no
        denoising; use 1.0 to prevent anchor frames from being corrupted).
    overlap_latent_frames:
        Number of latent frames shared between consecutive chunks (the SLB size).
        Corresponds to the temporal context the model sees from the previous chunk.
    new_latent_frames:
        Number of genuinely new latent frames generated per chunk.  The pixel
        frame count is (new_latent_frames − 1) × 8 + 1 with the default VAE
        scale factor of 8.
